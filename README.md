# UnendurableLove
A plugin adding various controversial items to minecraft gameplay

Currently implemented:

1)Leashes

    • take any player on a leash making them your pet
  
    • Even pet's death and rejoining won't tear you apart
  
    • Bind your pet to the fence and mind your own business knowing your toy will wait for you where you left it
  
    • Don't limit yourself to just one plaything
  
2)Nametag

    • Show your ownership putting a nametag on your pet
  
    • Give it a custom moniker using an anvil
  
    • If you came up with even more ̶d̶e̶g̶r̶a̶d̶i̶n̶g̶  wonderful nickname you can remove an old one with shears
  
3)Gag

    • If your pet is too loud then just put a gag on it!
  
    • Effectively prevents annoying talking even in death
  
    • Can be crafted with a string-leather-string pattern
  
    • Can be removed only by the master and with a key
  
    • The sympathetic owner who decided to permit his plaything to speak can craft a key with
    "iron-iron and a stick under right iron" pattern
    
 4)Rides
 
    • Finally make your pet useful by using it as a means of transportation
    
    • Curb it with a saddle and take a ride
    
    • It it's still not enough then whip it to make your disstressfull but devoted plaything to jump and run faster
    
    • Craft the Twisted Whip with a "twisting_vines-string-stick" pattern
  
  
And most importantly, show someone how much you love them or make them show how much they love you ✨🖤
