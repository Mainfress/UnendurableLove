# UnendurableLove

A plugin adding various controversial items to minecraft gameplay

## Features

### Leashes

- Take any player on a leash making them your pet
- Even pet's death and rejoining won't tear you apart
- Bind your pet to the fence and mind your own business knowing your toy will wait for you where you left it
- Don't limit yourself to just one plaything

### Nametag

- Show your ownership putting a nametag on your pet
- Give it a custom moniker using an anvil
- If you came up with even more ~~degrading~~ wonderful nickname you can remove an old one with shears

### Gag

- If your pet is too loud then just put a gag on it!
- Effectively prevents annoying talking even in death
- Can be removed only by the master and with a key
- The sympathetic owner who decided to permit his plaything to speak can craft a key

### Rides

- Finally, make your pet useful by using it as a means of transportation
- Curb it with a saddle and take a ride
- If it's still not enough then whip it to make your disstressfull but devoted plaything to jump and run faster

And most importantly, show someone how much you love them or make them show how much they love you âœ¨ðŸ–¤
