# UnendurableLove
A plugin adding various controversial items to minecraft gameplay

Currently implemented:
1)Leashes
  â€¢ take any player on a leash making them your pet
  â€¢ Even pet's death and rejoining won't tear you apart
  â€¢ Bind your pet to the fence and mind your own business knowing your toy will wait for you where you left it
  â€¢ Don't limit yourself to just one plaything
2)Nametag
  â€¢ Show your ownership putting a nametag on your pet
  â€¢ Give it a custom moniker using an anvil
  â€¢ If you came up with even more Ì¶dÌ¶eÌ¶gÌ¶rÌ¶aÌ¶dÌ¶iÌ¶nÌ¶gÌ¶  wonderful nickname you can remove an old one with shears
3)Gag
  â€¢ If your pet is too loud then just put a gag on it!
  â€¢ Effectively prevents annoying talking even in death
  â€¢ Can be crafted with a string-leather-string pattern
  â€¢ Can be removed only by the master and with a key
  â€¢ The sympathetic owner who decided to permit his plaything to speak can craft a key with "iron-iron and a stick under right iron" pattern
  
And most importantly, show someone how much you love them or make them show how much they love you âœ¨ğŸ–¤
